  title: Interpretable & Actionable Models using Attribute & Uncertainty Information
  abstract: "<p>
    Deep-learning models can be difficult to understand and
    control intuitively due to the black-box nature of these models.
    However, such lack of interpretability and human actionability
    in the modelsâ€™ decision processes make it difficult
    to trust these models in critical applications that affect
    the lives of people. We propose to alleviate these problems
    through the use of attribute and uncertainty models
    in deep networks. Our contributions are showing that attribute
    models can improve the interpretability of models
    in a direct and causal manner, as opposed to post-hoc explanations.
    The models do not compromise and sometimes
    even improve performance on the CUB and OAI datasets.
    We show how users can have better control of our models
    through a test-time intervention procedure where they
    can make contributions to intermediate model outputs (attributes)
    and improve overall target performance. Finally,
    we show the usefulness of understanding uncertainty on attributes
    to enable users to achieve better intervention.
