  title: Fully Integrated Electronic-Photonic Ultrasound Receiver Array for Endoscopic Imaging Applications in a Zero-Change 45nm CMOS-SOI Process
  abstract: "<p>
    This paper presents the first fully integrated 2-D array of electronic-photonic ultrasound sensors targeting low-power
    miniaturized ultrasound probes for endoscopic applications. Fabricated in a zero-change 45nm CMOS-SOI technology this
    Electronic-Photonic System on Chip (EPSoC), utilizes micro-ring resonators (MRR) as ultrasound sensors instead of the
    traditional piezoelectric or capacitive micromachined transducers (PMUTs or CMUTs). The photonic nature of the sensor
    enables remoting the power-hungry receive electronics outside the probe tip, lowering the power dissipation inside the human
    body, eliminates the electrical cabling and reduces fiber count by 4x using wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) MRR
    sensors coupled onto the same waveguide. The photonic sensing element demonstrates >30 MHz bandwidth, 7.3 mV/kPa
    overall sensitivity, while consuming 0.43 mW of power
