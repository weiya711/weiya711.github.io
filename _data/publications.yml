  title: The Sparse Abstract Machine
  abstract: "<p>
    We propose the Sparse Abstract Machine (SAM), an intermediate representation
    and abstract machine model for targeting sparse tensor algebra to
    reconfigurable and fixed-function spatial dataflow accelerators. SAM defines a
    streaming abstraction with sparse primitives that encompass a large space of
    scheduled tensor algebra expressions. SAM dataflow graphs naturally separate
    tensor formats from algorithms and is expressive enough to incorporate many
    sparse-iteration and hardware-specific optimizations. We show an automatic
    compilation technique from a high-level language to SAM and a set of hardware
    primitives which implement it. We evaluate the generality and extensibility of
    our sparse abstract machine, explore the performance space of sparse tensor
    algebra optimizations using SAM, and provide an example implementation of our
    SAM architecture.

  title: "Stardust: Compiling Sparse Tensor Algebra to a Reconfigurable Dataflow Architecture"
  abstract: "<p>
    We introduce Stardust, a compiler that compiles sparse tensor algebra to
    reconfigurable dataflow architectures (RDAs). Stardust introduces new
    user-provided data representation and scheduling language constructs for
    mapping to resource-constrained accelerated architectures. Stardust uses
    the information provided by these constructs to determine on-chip memory
    placement and to lower to the Capstan RDA through a parallel-patterns
    rewrite system that targets the Spatial programming model. The Stardust
    compiler is implemented as a new compilation path inside the TACO
    open-source system. Using cycle-accurate simulation, we demonstrate that
    Stardust can generate more Capstan tensor operations than its authors had
    implemented and that it results in 138× better performance than generated
    CPU kernels and 41× better performance than generated GPU kernels.

  title: Compilation of sparse array programming models
  abstract: "<p>
    This paper shows how to compile sparse array programming languages. A sparse
    array programming language is an array programming language that supports
    element-wise application, reduction, and broadcasting of arbitrary functions
    over dense and sparse arrays with any fill value. Such a language has great
    expressive power and can express sparse and dense linear and tensor algebra,
    functions over images, exclusion and inclusion filters, and even graph
    algorithms.
  
    Our compiler strategy generalizes prior work in the literature on sparse tensor
    algebra compilation to support any function applied to sparse arrays, instead
    of only addition and multiplication. To achieve this, we generalize the notion
    of sparse iteration spaces beyond intersections and unions. These iteration
    spaces are automatically derived by considering how algebraic properties
    annotated onto functions interact with the fill values of the arrays. We then
    show how to compile these iteration spaces to efficient code.
    
    When compared with two widely-used Python sparse array packages, our evaluation
    shows that we generate built-in sparse array library features with a
    performance of 1.4× to 53.7× when measured against PyData/Sparse for
    user-defined functions and between 0.98× and 5.53× when measured against
    SciPy/Sparse for sparse array slicing. Our technique outperforms PyData/Sparse
    by 6.58× to 70.3×, and (where applicable) performs between 0.96× and 28.9× that
    of a dense NumPy implementation, on end-to-end sparse array applications. We
    also implement graph linear algebra kernels in our system with a performance of
    between 0.56× and 3.50× compared to that of the hand-optimized
    SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS library.

  title: Fully Integrated Electronic-Photonic Ultrasound Receiver Array for Endoscopic Imaging Applications in a Zero-Change 45nm CMOS-SOI Process
  abstract: "<p>
    This paper presents the first fully integrated 2-D array of electronic-photonic ultrasound sensors targeting low-power
    miniaturized ultrasound probes for endoscopic applications. Fabricated in a zero-change 45nm CMOS-SOI technology this
    Electronic-Photonic System on Chip (EPSoC), utilizes micro-ring resonators (MRR) as ultrasound sensors instead of the
    traditional piezoelectric or capacitive micromachined transducers (PMUTs or CMUTs). The photonic nature of the sensor
    enables remoting the power-hungry receive electronics outside the probe tip, lowering the power dissipation inside the human
    body, eliminates the electrical cabling and reduces fiber count by 4x using wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) MRR
    sensors coupled onto the same waveguide. The photonic sensing element demonstrates >30 MHz bandwidth, 7.3 mV/kPa
    overall sensitivity, while consuming 0.43 mW of power
