  title: Ring Resonator Based Ultrasound Detection in a Zero-Change Advanced CMOS-SOI Process
  abstract: "<p>
    Optical ultrasound detection using microring resonators (MRRs) in a
    zero-change 45nm CMOS-SOI electronic-photonic platform with high intrinsic
    sensitivity of 39.6 f m/kPa and frequency response of 6MHz is reported.
